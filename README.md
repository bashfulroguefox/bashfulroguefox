- 👋 Hi, I’m @bashfulroguefox,  No one of consequence.
- 👀 I’m interested in computers/electronics, music, comedy, writing, people, and about a million other rabbit holes that are a trillion miles deep and un-masterable. A fool of considerable proportion pursuing an endless list of foolish errands. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning infosec, ethical hacking, web dev, system programming, DB/network/on-prem and cloud environment administration. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything computer, music, writing, car, horticulture related. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Please message me here, and if I can trust you we can pursue other avenues of communication. 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him - also known to answer to "*sshole" and "dumb*ss" 
- ⚡ Fun fact: all facts are fun if you're up for having fun with facts. Time is a manmade construct of which i do not abide, dude. That rug really tied the room together, did it not?
